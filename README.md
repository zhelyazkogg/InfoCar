# InfoCar

This is my first project built in Kotlin. The project is supposed to be a car diary where you can add your vehicle's /one or more/ data, add the expenses for the car /fuel, car parts, insurances, etc/.\
At the start of the app you will see a log in page where you can either log in, if you have an account, or register if you don't.\
The app is not finished.\
I have used the Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database for this project, but now I see that a better practice would have been to use the Could Firestore. I have to rewrite the project a little bit because of that, I think.\ 
This project, like I said, is my first project built in Kotlin and it was my Final Year Project at my university and I had ran out of time and didn't have the chance to complete my UI/UX design.\
